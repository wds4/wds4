Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

I am primarily interested in freedome technology; more specifically in decentralized ratings, reputation and web of trust.

I've been working in the nostr space since Dec 2022.

I believe that graph databases and nostr are a match made in heaven, especially where web of trust is concerned. As of Jan 2025, I am working on pairing neo4j with nostr relays, notably strfry and its derivatives (such as relay.tools) with the goal of a next generation personalized Web of Trust nostr relay.

Current tools include: nostr, neo4j, javascript, node, react, jQuery, electron, sqlite3, vis.js, typescript, redux.

Previous tools: ipfs, electron
